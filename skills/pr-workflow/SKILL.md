# PR Workflow Management

Comprehensive pull request lifecycle management from creation to merge.

**CRITICAL**: Use `mergeable_state: "clean"` (not `mergeable: true`) to determine if PR is ready to merge.

## What is PR Workflow Management?

PR workflow management is a comprehensive process that handles the complete pull request lifecycle from creation through merge. It includes pre-PR validation, continuous status monitoring, automated bot feedback handling, and merge coordination to ensure code quality and CI/CD compliance.

**Core Concept**: A PR should be:
- **Validated** - Pre-PR checks pass (tests, linting, build)
- **Monitored** - Status checked continuously
- **Addressed** - Bot feedback handled automatically
- **Clean** - All checks pass before merge
- **Coordinated** - Merged only when ready

## Why This Matters

### The Problem: Manual PR Management

**Without automated workflow:**
- PRs created with failing tests
- CI failures go unnoticed
- Bot feedback ignored
- PRs merged prematurely
- Code quality issues slip through

**Example of problems:**
```
# PR created without checks
gh pr create --title "feat: new feature"
# Tests failing, but PR created anyway
# CI fails, but no one notices
# PR sits for days with failures
# Eventually merged with broken code
```

### The Solution: Automated Lifecycle Management

**With PR workflow:**
- Pre-PR checks ensure quality
- Continuous monitoring catches issues
- Bot feedback addressed automatically
- Merge only when all checks pass
- Consistent quality standards

**Example of success:**
```
# Pre-PR checks run first
sbt test && sbt scalafmtCheck
# All checks pass
# PR created
# Status monitored continuously
# Bot feedback addressed automatically
# Merged only when mergeable_state: "clean"
```

## When to Use This Skill

**APPLY WHEN:**
- Creating pull requests
- Monitoring PR status and CI checks
- Addressing bot comments and feedback
- Preparing PR for merge
- Managing PR lifecycle autonomously

**DO NOT USE WHEN:**
- Simple single-file changes (use `/create-pr` command instead)
- Not using GitHub
- PR already merged

## Core Directive

**Pre-PR checks → Create PR → Monitor → Address feedback → Merge when clean.**

## Phase 1: Pre-PR Checks

**Before creating PR, verify:**

### 1. Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Type checking
sbt compile
# or
npm run typecheck
# or
mypy .

# Linting
sbt scalafmtCheck
# or
npm run lint
# or
ruff check .
```

**Required:** All checks must pass

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
# Run full test suite
sbt test
# or
npm test
# or
pytest
```

**Required:** All tests must pass

### 3. Security Scan

**Check for:**
- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords)
- Hardcoded paths (use environment variables)
- Insecure dependencies
- SQL injection risks
- XSS vulnerabilities

**Tools:**
```bash
# GitGuardian, TruffleHog, or similar
git secrets --scan
# or
npm audit
# or
safety check
```

**Required:** No critical security issues

### 4. Find PR Template

**Check for PR template:**

```bash
# Common locations
.github/pull_request_template.md
docs/pull_request_template.md
PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```

**Use template** if available, fill all required sections

### 5. Verify Branch Status

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Ensure not on main/master
# If on main/master, create feature branch first
```

## Phase 2: Create PR

### Using GitHub CLI

```bash
# Create PR with title and body
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add price calculator with tax" \
  --body "Implements price calculation with configurable tax rate.

- Added PriceCalculator class
- Added unit tests (100% coverage)
- Updated documentation

Closes #123"
```

### PR Description Template

**Include:**
- **What changed**: Brief summary
- **Why**: Motivation/context
- **How**: Implementation approach
- **Testing**: How tested
- **Checklist**: Pre-PR checks completed

**Example:**
```markdown
## What Changed
Added PriceCalculator class with tax calculation support.

## Why
Needed to standardize price calculations across services.

## How
- Created PriceCalculator class
- Added calculateTotal method
- Implemented tax calculation logic

## Testing
- Unit tests added (100% coverage)
- Integration tests pass
- Manual testing completed

## Checklist
- [x] Code compiles
- [x] Tests pass
- [x] No security issues
- [x] Documentation updated
```

## Phase 3: Autonomous Monitoring

**After PR creation, monitor continuously:**

### Check PR Status

**Use GitHub API (via `gh` CLI or API):**

```bash
# Get PR details
gh pr view <pr-number> --json mergeableState,statusCheckRollup,comments

# Key fields:
# - mergeableState: "clean" | "dirty" | "unstable" | "blocked"
# - statusCheckRollup: Array of CI check results
# - comments: Array of comments (including bot comments)
```

### Critical Insight: mergeable vs mergeableState

**These are DIFFERENT:**

- `mergeable: true` → Only means "no git conflicts"
- `mergeable_state: "clean"` → Means "all checks passed, ready to merge"

**Only merge when `mergeable_state: "clean"`**

### Monitoring Loop

**Poll every 30-60 seconds:**

1. **Check mergeable_state:**
   ```bash
   gh pr view <pr-number> --json mergeableState -q .mergeableState
   ```

2. **Read all comments:**
   ```bash
   gh pr view <pr-number> --json comments -q '.comments[] | select(.author.type == "Bot")'
   ```

3. **Check CI status:**
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <pr-number>
   ```

4. **Address feedback:**
   - Fix issues mentioned in bot comments
   - Respond to review comments
   - Rerun failed checks if flaky

5. **Push fixes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: address PR feedback"
   git push
   ```

6. **Wait for re-validation:**
   - Wait 30-60 seconds
   - Check status again
   - Repeat until `mergeable_state: "clean"`

## Phase 4: Addressing Feedback

### Bot Comments

**Common bot feedback:**
- Code coverage too low
- Linting errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing tests
- Documentation issues

**Action:** Fix issues, push, wait for re-check

### Review Comments

**Human reviewer feedback:**
- Code style suggestions
- Logic questions
- Performance concerns
- Architecture suggestions

**Action:** 
- Address each comment
- Reply to reviewer
- Push changes
- Mark threads as resolved

### CI Failures

**If CI fails:**

1. **Check failure reason:**
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch
   ```

2. **Fix issues:**
   - Update code
   - Fix tests
   - Update configuration

3. **Rerun flaky tests:**
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <pr-number> --rerun-failed
   ```

4. **Push and wait:**
   - Push fixes
   - Wait for CI to complete
   - Verify all checks pass

## Phase 5: Merge (Only When Clean)

**Merge ONLY when:**

- `mergeable_state: "clean"` (not just `mergeable: true`)
- All CI checks passed
- Zero unaddressed comments
- All review threads resolved
- Required approvals obtained

### Merge Command

```bash
# Merge PR
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch

# Or merge via GitHub UI if preferred
gh pr view <pr-number> --web
```

### Merge Strategies

**Choose based on project:**
- **Squash**: Single commit (clean history)
- **Merge**: Preserve commit history
- **Rebase**: Linear history (if allowed)

## Workflow Summary

```
1. Pre-PR Checks
   ├─ Type check ✓
   ├─ Tests pass ✓
   ├─ Security scan ✓
   └─ PR template filled ✓

2. Create PR
   └─ gh pr create

3. Monitor Loop (every 30-60s)
   ├─ Check mergeable_state
   ├─ Read bot comments
   ├─ Check CI status
   ├─ Address feedback
   ├─ Push fixes
   └─ Wait for re-validation

4. Merge (when mergeable_state: "clean")
   └─ gh pr merge
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**Use with:**
- `/git-workflow` - Clean commit history
- `/tdd-workflow` - Tests written first
- `/best-practices-enforcement` - Code quality

## Common Pitfalls

### Merging Too Early

**Problem:** Merging when `mergeable: true` but checks still running

**Solution:** Wait for `mergeable_state: "clean"`

### Ignoring Bot Comments

**Problem:** Not addressing automated feedback

**Solution:** Read all comments, fix issues, push

### Not Monitoring Continuously

**Problem:** PR stuck waiting for fixes

**Solution:** Poll every 30-60 seconds, address immediately

### Skipping Pre-PR Checks

**Problem:** PR fails CI immediately

**Solution:** Run all checks locally before creating PR

## Success Criteria

- **All pre-PR checks pass** before creating PR
- **PR created** with complete description
- **All bot comments addressed** and resolved
- **All CI checks pass** (mergeable_state: "clean")
- **All review comments** addressed
- **PR merged** successfully

## Output

**This skill produces:**
- PR created with proper description
- All feedback addressed
- PR merged when ready
- Clean git history

## Remember

> "mergeable_state: 'clean' means ready to merge, not mergeable: true"

> "Address every bot comment - they're usually right"

> "Monitor continuously - don't let PRs sit waiting"
