# Best Practices Enforcement

Systematically validate code against universal best practices and language-specific patterns. Report violations with specific recommendations.

## What is Best Practices Enforcement?

Best practices enforcement is a systematic code review process that validates code against established standards across multiple dimensions: code quality, security, testing, performance, architecture, and error handling. It combines universal principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI) with language-specific patterns (Python type hints, Scala immutability, Go error handling, etc.) to ensure code meets quality standards.

**Core Concept**: Code should be:
- ✅ **Correct** - Works as intended, handles edge cases
- ✅ **Secure** - Validates input, follows least privilege, no vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Testable** - Well-tested with behavior-focused tests
- ✅ **Performant** - Efficient algorithms, measured optimizations
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Clear structure, separation of concerns, readable
- ✅ **Robust** - Proper error handling, fail-fast patterns

## Why This Matters

### The Problem: Inconsistent Code Quality

**Without systematic enforcement:**
- Code quality varies between developers
- Security vulnerabilities slip through
- Technical debt accumulates
- Code becomes hard to maintain
- Performance issues go unnoticed
- Tests are missing or poorly written

**Example of problems:**
```
# Security issue: No input validation
def process_user_email(email):
    db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = %s" % email)  # SQL injection risk

# Code quality: Violates SRP
class UserService:
    def create_user(self): ...
    def send_email(self): ...  # Should be separate EmailService
    def generate_report(self): ...  # Should be separate ReportService

# Testing: Tests implementation, not behavior
def test_user_creation():
    assert user._internal_state == "created"  # Testing private state
```

### The Solution: Systematic Validation

**With best practices enforcement:**
- ✅ Consistent quality across codebase
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities caught early
- ✅ Technical debt prevented
- ✅ Maintainable, readable code
- ✅ Performance issues identified
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

**Example of improvements:**
```
# Security: Input validated
def process_user_email(email: str) -> User:
    if not is_valid_email(email):
        raise ValueError("Invalid email format")
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", email)

# Code quality: Single responsibility
class UserService:
    def create_user(self): ...

class EmailService:
    def send_email(self): ...

# Testing: Tests behavior
def test_user_creation():
    user = service.create_user("test@example.com")
    assert user.email == "test@example.com"  # Test public behavior
```

## Understanding the Categories

### 1. Code Quality

**Principles**: SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Boy Scout Rule

**What it checks:**
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Classes/functions do one thing
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - No code duplication
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - Simple solutions preferred
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - No premature features
- Meaningful names - Clear, descriptive identifiers
- Pure functions - No side effects where possible

**Why it matters**: Maintainable code is easier to understand, modify, and debug.

### 2. Security

**Principles**: Input validation, least privilege, defense in depth

**What it checks:**
- Input validation - All user input validated
- Least privilege - Minimal permissions required
- Defense in depth - Multiple security layers
- Secure defaults - Safe by default
- No secrets in code - Credentials properly managed
- SQL injection prevention - Parameterized queries
- XSS prevention - Output sanitization

**Why it matters**: Security vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and legal issues.

### 3. Testing

**Principles**: AAA pattern, behavior over implementation, isolation

**What it checks:**
- Tests exist - Code is tested
- AAA pattern - Arrange, Act, Assert structure
- Behavior over implementation - Test what, not how
- Isolation - Tests don't depend on each other
- Edge cases - Boundary conditions tested
- Test coverage - Critical paths covered

**Why it matters**: Tests provide confidence in code correctness and enable safe refactoring.

### 4. Performance

**Principles**: Measure first, optimize bottlenecks, avoid premature optimization

**What it checks:**
- No premature optimization - Optimize after measuring
- Bottlenecks identified - Performance issues known
- Efficient algorithms - Appropriate data structures
- Caching - Where beneficial
- Resource cleanup - Memory, connections, files

**Why it matters**: Performance issues impact user experience and system scalability.

### 5. Architecture

**Principles**: Interface-centric design, separation of concerns, dependency injection

**What it checks:**
- Interface-centric - Depend on abstractions
- Separation of concerns - Clear boundaries
- Dependency injection - Loose coupling
- Clear boundaries - Module responsibilities defined
- Layered architecture - Proper layering

**Why it matters**: Good architecture enables scalability, testability, and maintainability.

### 6. Error Handling

**Principles**: Fail fast, explicit errors, proper propagation

**What it checks:**
- Fail fast - Errors detected early
- Explicit errors - Clear error types
- Proper propagation - Errors handled at appropriate layer
- Appropriate layers - Errors handled where context exists
- No silent failures - Errors are visible
- Swallowed errors - No empty catch blocks
- InterruptedExceptions - Handled correctly

**Why it matters**: Proper error handling prevents bugs from propagating and improves debugging.

## Prerequisites

1. **Detect language(s)** from file extensions or paths:
   - `.scala` → Scala (`@shared/backend/scala/index.mdc`)
   - `.py` → Python (`@shared/backend/python/index.mdc`)
   - `.go` → Go (`@shared/backend/go/index.mdc`)
   - `.java` → Java (`@shared/backend/java/index.mdc`)
   - `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx` → JavaScript/TypeScript (`@shared/frontend/javascript-typescript/index.mdc`)
   - `.swift` → Swift (`@shared/mobile/swift/index.mdc`)
   - `.kt` → Kotlin (`@shared/mobile/kotlin/index.mdc`)
   - `.m`, `.mm` → Objective-C (`@shared/mobile/objective-c/index.mdc`)
2. **Load generic rules** (always): `@shared/generic/`
3. **Load language-specific index** (if detected): Use index file to discover all language rules

## Methodology

### Step 1: Detect Languages and Load Rules

**CRITICAL: You MUST actually load the rule files, not just mention them.**

#### 1.1 Detect Language(s) from Target Files

**FIRST: Scan the actual target files/directories to detect languages**

1. Use `glob_file_search` or `list_dir` to find files in the target directory
2. Check file extensions in the actual files found:
   - `.py` → Python
   - `.scala` → Scala
   - `.go` → Go
   - `.java` → Java
   - `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx` → JavaScript/TypeScript
   - `.swift` → Swift
   - `.kt` → Kotlin
   - `.m`, `.mm` → Objective-C
3. **Announce detected languages**: Write a message like "Detected languages: Python, Scala" so the user can see what was found
4. **IMPORTANT**: If multiple languages detected (e.g., both `.py` and `.scala` files), load rules for ALL detected languages

#### 1.2 ALWAYS Load Generic Rules First

**Announce and load generic rules:**

Write: "📚 Loading generic best practice rules..."

**Use `read_file` to load these files:**
- `@shared/generic/code-quality/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/security/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/testing/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/performance/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/architecture/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/error-handling/universal-patterns.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/error-handling/silent-failure-check.mdc`

After loading, write: "SUCCESS: Loaded generic rules"

#### 1.3 AUTOMATICALLY Load Language-Specific Index

**For EACH detected language, announce and load the index file:**

**Before loading each language, write a message like:**
- "Loading Python best practice rules..."
- "Loading Scala best practice rules..."
- "Loading Go best practice rules..."
- etc.

**Then use `read_file` to load the index file for each detected language:**

- **Python** (if `.py` files found): `@shared/backend/python/index.mdc`
- **Scala** (if `.scala` files found): `@shared/backend/scala/index.mdc`
- **Go** (if `.go` files found): `@shared/backend/go/index.mdc`
- **Java** (if `.java` files found): `@shared/backend/java/index.mdc`
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (if `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx` files found): `@shared/frontend/javascript-typescript/index.mdc`
- **Swift** (if `.swift` files found): `@shared/mobile/swift/index.mdc`
- **Kotlin** (if `.kt` files found): `@shared/mobile/kotlin/index.mdc`
- **Objective-C** (if `.m`, `.mm` files found): `@shared/mobile/objective-c/index.mdc`

**After loading each index, write: "SUCCESS: Loaded [Language] index"**

**CRITICAL**: If multiple languages detected (e.g., both Python and Scala), load indexes for ALL of them.

#### 1.4 Load Relevant Language-Specific Rule Files

**After reading each language index, announce and load specific rule files:**

**For Python (if `.py` files detected):**

Write: "Loading Python-specific rule files..."

Load these files using `read_file`:
- `@shared/backend/python/language/type-annotations-everywhere.mdc` - Type hints
- `@shared/backend/python/language/error-handling-patterns.mdc` - Exception handling
- `@shared/backend/python/language/pythonic-patterns.mdc` - Comprehensions, dataclasses, EAFP
- `@shared/backend/python/meta/pep8-style-guide.mdc` - PEP 8 style guide
- `@shared/backend/python/language/async-patterns.mdc` - If async code detected
- `@shared/backend/python/testing/python-testing-best-practices.mdc` - If reviewing tests
- `@shared/backend/python/performance/profiling-and-optimization.mdc` - If reviewing performance

Write: "SUCCESS: Loaded Python-specific rules"

**For Scala (if `.scala` files detected):**

Write: "Loading Scala-specific rule files..."

Load relevant rules from the index (language/, architecture/, testing/, performance/, data/, meta/)

Write: "SUCCESS: Loaded Scala-specific rules"

**For other languages:** Follow the same pattern - announce, load, confirm.

**IMPORTANT**:
- **Always announce before loading**: Write "Loading [Language] rules..." so user can see progress
- Use `read_file` tool to actually load these files - don't just mention them
- Load language-specific rules BEFORE analyzing code
- **If multiple languages detected, load rules for ALL detected languages** (e.g., if both Python and Scala files found, load both sets of rules)
- After loading each language's rules, write a confirmation message

### Step 2: Analyze Code Structure

**After loading all rules, analyze the code:**

For each file/module, check:

1. **Code Quality**: SRP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Boy Scout Rule, meaningful names, pure functions
2. **Security**: Input validation, least privilege, defense in depth, secure defaults, no secrets
3. **Testing**: Tests exist, AAA pattern, behavior over implementation, isolation, edge cases
4. **Performance**: No premature optimization, bottlenecks measured, efficient algorithms, caching
5. **Architecture**: Interface-centric, separation of concerns, dependency injection, clear boundaries
6. **Error Handling**: Fail fast, explicit errors, proper propagation, appropriate layers

### Step 3: Language-Specific Validation

**Apply the language-specific rules you loaded in Step 1.4:**

- **Python**: Check for type annotations, PEP 8 compliance, Pythonic patterns (comprehensions vs loops, EAFP, context managers), async/await patterns
- **Scala**: Option/Either/Try, immutability, case classes, referential transparency, pattern matching
- **Go**: Small interfaces, explicit error handling, context patterns, concurrency patterns
- **Java**: Modern Java patterns, interfaces over inheritance, style guide
- **JS/TS**: Type safety, strict mode, async/await patterns, defensive programming
- **Swift**: Optionals, protocol-oriented design, concurrency patterns, style guide
- **Kotlin**: Sealed classes, coroutines, null safety, style guide
- **Objective-C**: ARC memory management, style guide, iOS best practices

**Reference the specific rule files you loaded** when identifying violations.

### Step 4: Generate Report

Structure findings by category with violations, locations, recommendations, and priority (Critical/Warning/Suggestion). Report in chat, not file.

## Reference Rules

**Generic (always load):**
- `@shared/generic/code-quality/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/security/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/testing/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/performance/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/architecture/core-principles.mdc`
- `@shared/generic/error-handling/universal-patterns.mdc`

**Language-specific indexes (load based on detected language):**
- Scala: `@shared/backend/scala/index.mdc`
- Python: `@shared/backend/python/index.mdc`
- Go: `@shared/backend/go/index.mdc`
- Java: `@shared/backend/java/index.mdc`
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `@shared/frontend/javascript-typescript/index.mdc`
- Swift: `@shared/mobile/swift/index.mdc`
- Kotlin: `@shared/mobile/kotlin/index.mdc`
- Objective-C: `@shared/mobile/objective-c/index.mdc`

**After loading index, load specific rule files** from categories: `language/`, `testing/`, `performance/`, `architecture/`, `data/`, `meta/` as needed.

## Output

Best Practices Audit Report (in chat, not file):
1. Summary: compliance status with counts
2. By category: violations, locations, recommendations, priority (Critical/Warning/Suggestion)
3. Language-specific findings if applicable

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multi-Language Codebase

**When codebase has multiple languages:**

```python
# Python file: src/api/handlers.py
def handle_request(data):
    # Check Python-specific: type hints, PEP 8, Pythonic patterns
    pass
```

```scala
// Scala file: src/services/UserService.scala
class UserService {
  // Check Scala-specific: Option/Either, immutability, case classes
}
```

**Approach**: Detect all languages, load rules for ALL detected languages, apply language-specific checks to each file.

### Pattern 2: Security-First Review

**For security-critical code:**

1. Load security rules first
2. Check input validation
3. Check authentication/authorization
4. Check sensitive data handling
5. Check for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

**Priority**: Security violations are always Critical.

### Pattern 3: Test-Driven Validation

**When reviewing test files:**

1. Check test structure (AAA pattern)
2. Verify behavior-focused tests (not implementation)
3. Check test isolation
4. Verify edge cases covered
5. Check test naming clarity

**Focus**: Tests should be maintainable and reliable.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Mentioning Rules Without Loading

**Bad:**
```
"I'll check against SOLID principles..."
# Never actually loads the rule files
```

**Good:**
```
"Loading generic best practice rules..."
# Actually uses read_file to load @shared/generic/code-quality/core-principles.mdc
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Skipping Language Detection

**Bad:**
```
# Assumes Python without checking files
# Loads Python rules for Scala codebase
```

**Good:**
```
# Scans files first
glob_file_search("**/*.scala")
# Detects: Scala
# Loads: Scala rules
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Single Language When Multiple Present

**Bad:**
```
# Detects: Python, Scala
# Only loads Python rules
```

**Good:**
```
# Detects: Python, Scala
# Loads: Python rules AND Scala rules
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Vague Recommendations

**Bad:**
```
Violation: Code quality issue
Recommendation: Fix it
```

**Good:**
```
Violation: SRP violation in UserService
Location: src/services/UserService.scala:45
Issue: UserService handles both user CRUD and email sending
Recommendation: Extract EmailService, keep UserService focused on user management
Priority: Medium
```

## Examples

**Example 1: Code Quality Violation**
```
Violation: SRP violation in UserService
Location: src/services/UserService.scala:45
Issue: UserService handles both user CRUD and email sending
Recommendation: Extract EmailService, keep UserService focused on user management
Priority: Medium
```

**Example 2: Security Violation**
```
Violation: Missing input validation
Location: src/api/UserController.scala:23
Issue: Email parameter not validated before database query
Recommendation: Add email format validation using regex or library
Priority: Critical
```

**Example 3: Testing Violation**
```
Violation: Test checks implementation detail
Location: src/test/UserServiceTest.scala:67
Issue: Test asserts on private _internalState variable
Recommendation: Test public behavior (user creation success) instead
Priority: Medium
```

**Example 4: Performance Violation**
```
Violation: N+1 query problem
Location: src/services/ReportService.scala:89
Issue: Loop executes database query for each iteration
Recommendation: Use batch query or eager loading to fetch all data at once
Priority: High
```

**Example 5: Architecture Violation**
```
Violation: Tight coupling to concrete implementation
Location: src/services/OrderService.scala:12
Issue: Directly instantiates DatabaseConnection instead of using dependency injection
Recommendation: Inject IDatabaseConnection interface, use DI container
Priority: Medium
```

## Integration

Use with `/code-review` (broader review), `/service-refactoring` (apply during refactoring), `/service-migration` (ensure migrated code follows practices).

## Execution Checklist

**When executing this skill, follow this checklist and ANNOUNCE each step:**

1. **Detect languages**:
   - Scan target files/directories for language extensions using `glob_file_search` or `list_dir`
   - **Write**: "Detected languages: [list languages found]" (e.g., "Detected languages: Python, Scala")

2. **Load generic rules**:
   - **Write**: "Loading generic best practice rules..."
   - Use `read_file` to load all 6 generic rule files
   - **Write**: "SUCCESS: Loaded generic rules"

3. **Load language indexes**:
   - For EACH detected language:
     - **Write**: "Loading [Language] best practice rules..."
     - Use `read_file` to load the index file (e.g., `@shared/backend/python/index.mdc`)
     - **Write**: "SUCCESS: Loaded [Language] index"
   - **If multiple languages**: Load indexes for ALL of them (e.g., both Python and Scala)

4. **Load specific rules**:
   - For EACH detected language:
     - **Write**: "Loading [Language]-specific rule files..."
     - Load relevant rule files based on index contents (e.g., for Python: type-annotations, PEP 8, error-handling, pythonic-patterns)
     - **Write**: "SUCCESS: Loaded [Language]-specific rules"
   - **If multiple languages**: Load specific rules for ALL detected languages

5. **Analyze code**:
   - **Write**: "Analyzing code against loaded rules..."
   - Apply all loaded rules to find violations

6. **Report findings**:
   - Structure violations by category with locations and recommendations
   - Reference which language-specific rules were applied

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- **Always announce loading steps** - write messages so user can see "Loading..." progress
- You MUST actually load rule files using `read_file` - don't just mention them
- If Python detected (`.py` files), you MUST load Python-specific rules
- If Scala detected (`.scala` files), you MUST load Scala-specific rules
- **If BOTH Python and Scala detected, load rules for BOTH languages**
- Load language-specific rules BEFORE analyzing code
- After each loading step, write a confirmation message

## Notes

- **CRITICAL**: You MUST actually load rule files using `read_file` - don't just mention them
- **CRITICAL**: Always announce loading steps with messages like "Loading..." so user can see progress
- Report in chat, not files
- Language-aware: auto-detect and apply language rules based on actual files found
- Prioritize critical security/correctness issues
- Every violation needs specific recommendation
- Consider codebase's existing patterns
- If Python detected, you MUST load Python-specific rules (type annotations, PEP 8, Pythonic patterns)
- If multiple languages detected, load rules for ALL detected languages
