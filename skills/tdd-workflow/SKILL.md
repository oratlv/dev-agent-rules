# Test-Driven Development Workflow

Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

**CRITICAL**: Write tests FIRST, then implement. Tests drive design and ensure correctness.

**The Iron Law**: NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST. Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over. If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

## What is Test-Driven Development?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where you write tests before writing implementation code. It follows a three-phase cycle: Red (write failing test), Green (make test pass with minimal code), Refactor (improve code while keeping tests green).

**Core Concept**: Tests drive design and ensure correctness:
- **Red** - Write failing test that describes desired behavior
- **Green** - Write minimal code to make test pass
- **Refactor** - Improve code quality while keeping tests green

**Benefits:**
- Test coverage from the start
- Tests serve as documentation
- Safety net for refactoring
- Design driven by requirements
- Confidence in code correctness

## Why This Matters

### The Problem: Tests Written After Implementation

**Without TDD:**
- Tests written after code (may miss edge cases)
- Code written without clear requirements
- Refactoring is risky (no safety net)
- Low test coverage
- Tests test implementation, not behavior

**Example of problems:**
```
# Write implementation first
def calculate_total(price, tax_rate):
    return price * (1 + tax_rate)

# Then write test (if remembered)
def test_calculate_total():
    assert calculate_total(100, 0.1) == 110
# Misses edge cases: negative prices, zero tax, etc.
```

### The Solution: Tests Drive Development

**With TDD:**
- Requirements clarified through tests
- Edge cases considered upfront
- Refactoring is safe (tests catch breaks)
- High test coverage
- Tests focus on behavior, not implementation

**Example of success:**
```
# Write test first (Red)
def test_calculate_total_with_negative_price():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        calculate_total(-100, 0.1)

# Implement to pass (Green)
def calculate_total(price, tax_rate):
    if price < 0:
        raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative")
    return price * (1 + tax_rate)

# Refactor for clarity (Refactor)
def calculate_total(price: float, tax_rate: float) -> float:
    """Calculate total price with tax."""
    if price < 0:
        raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative")
    return price * (1 + tax_rate)
```

## When to Use This Skill

**APPLY WHEN:**
- Starting new features or functionality
- Adding methods/functions to existing code
- Refactoring with safety net
- Ensuring test coverage
- Learning codebase through tests
- Building confidence in changes

**SKIP WHEN:**
- Quick bug fixes (fix first, test after)
- Purely cosmetic changes (formatting, comments)
- Documentation-only changes
- Configuration changes without logic

## Core Directive

**Red → Green → Refactor**: Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve code.

## The TDD Cycle

### 1. Red: Write Failing Test

**Write a test that describes desired behavior:**

```scala
// Example: Scala/ScalaTest
test("should calculate total price with tax") {
  val calculator = new PriceCalculator(taxRate = 0.1)
  calculator.calculateTotal(100.0) shouldBe 110.0
}
```

**Key principles:**
- Test describes WHAT, not HOW
- Test should fail for the right reason (missing functionality, not syntax error)
- One behavior per test
- Use descriptive test names

### 2. Green: Make Test Pass

**Write minimal code to pass the test:**

```scala
// Minimal implementation
class PriceCalculator(taxRate: Double) {
  def calculateTotal(price: Double): Double = {
    price * (1 + taxRate)  // Just enough to pass
  }
}
```

**Key principles:**
- Write ONLY enough code to pass
- Don't optimize yet
- Don't add features not tested
- Commit when test passes

### 3. Refactor: Improve Code

**Improve code while keeping tests green:**

```scala
// Refactored implementation
class PriceCalculator(taxRate: Double) {
  def calculateTotal(price: Double): Double = {
    require(price >= 0, "Price must be non-negative")
    price + calculateTax(price)
  }
  
  private def calculateTax(price: Double): Double = {
    price * taxRate
  }
}
```

**Key principles:**
- Tests must stay green
- Improve readability, structure, performance
- Remove duplication
- Extract methods/classes as needed

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

**Before writing tests:**
1. Read existing code to understand patterns
2. Check similar features for test structure
3. Identify edge cases and boundaries
4. Plan test cases (happy path, edge cases, errors)

### Step 2: Write First Test

**Create test file (if needed) or add to existing:**

```bash
# Example: Scala project structure
src/test/scala/com/example/PriceCalculatorTest.scala
```

**Write failing test:**
- Use existing test framework conventions
- Follow naming patterns (`should_do_something` or `test_does_something`)
- Test one behavior
- Use descriptive assertions

### Step 3: Run Test (Verify Red)

**Run test to confirm it fails:**

```bash
sbt test
# or
npm test
# or
pytest
```

**Expected:** Test fails with clear error (missing method, wrong return value, etc.)

### Step 4: Implement Minimal Code

**Write just enough to pass:**

- Don't over-engineer
- Don't add features not tested
- Focus on making test green

### Step 5: Run Test (Verify Green)

**Run test again:**

```bash
sbt test
```

**Expected:** Test passes

**Commit when green:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "test: add price calculation with tax"
```

### Step 6: Refactor (Keep Green)

**Improve code quality:**
- Extract methods
- Rename for clarity
- Remove duplication
- Add error handling (with tests)

**After each refactor:**
- Run tests (must stay green)
- Commit if significant improvement

### Step 7: Repeat Cycle

**For next behavior:**
1. Write next failing test
2. Make it pass
3. Refactor
4. Continue until feature complete

## Test Structure

### Test Organization

**Group related tests:**

```scala
class PriceCalculatorTest extends AnyFlatSpec {
  
  "calculateTotal" should "add tax to base price" in {
    // test
  }
  
  it should "handle zero price" in {
    // test
  }
  
  it should "reject negative prices" in {
    // test
  }
}
```

### Test Categories

**Write tests for:**
- **Happy path**: Normal operation
- **Edge cases**: Boundaries, empty inputs, nulls
- **Error cases**: Invalid inputs, exceptions
- **Integration**: Multiple components together

## Best Practices

### Test Quality

**Good tests:**
- **Fast**: Run in milliseconds
- **Independent**: No test depends on another
- **Repeatable**: Same result every time
- **Self-validating**: Clear pass/fail
- **Timely**: Written before implementation

**Bad tests:**
- Slow (database, network calls)
- Dependent on execution order
- Non-deterministic (random, time-dependent)
- Unclear what they test
- Written after implementation

### Test Naming

**Use descriptive names:**

```scala
// Good
test("should calculate total with 10% tax rate")

// Bad
test("test1")
test("calculate")
```

### Test Size

**Keep tests focused:**
- One behavior per test
- 3-10 lines of test code
- Clear setup → act → assert

### Test Coverage

**Aim for:**
- 80%+ code coverage
- 100% critical path coverage
- All public APIs tested
- Edge cases covered

## Language-Specific Patterns

### Scala (ScalaTest)

```scala
import org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec
import org.scalatest.matchers.should.Matchers

class CalculatorSpec extends AnyFlatSpec with Matchers {
  "Calculator" should "add two numbers" in {
    Calculator.add(2, 3) shouldBe 5
  }
}
```

### Python (pytest)

```python
import pytest

def test_calculate_total():
    calculator = PriceCalculator(tax_rate=0.1)
    assert calculator.calculate_total(100.0) == 110.0
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest/Vitest)

```typescript
describe('PriceCalculator', () => {
  it('should calculate total with tax', () => {
    const calculator = new PriceCalculator(0.1);
    expect(calculator.calculateTotal(100)).toBe(110);
  });
});
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**Use with:**
- `/git-workflow` - Commit after each green test
- `/best-practices-enforcement` - Ensure test quality
- `/service-refactoring` - Refactor with test safety net

## Common Pitfalls

### Writing Too Much Code

**Problem:** Implementing full feature before tests pass

**Solution:** One test → minimal code → refactor → next test

### Skipping Refactor Phase

**Problem:** Code works but messy

**Solution:** Always refactor after green, commit clean code

### Testing Implementation Details

**Problem:** Tests break when refactoring

**Solution:** Test behavior, not implementation

### Not Running Tests Often

**Problem:** Many failures at once

**Solution:** Run tests after each small change

## Success Criteria

- **Tests written first** (before implementation)
- **Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed**
- **All tests pass** before moving on
- **Code refactored** after tests pass
- **Test coverage** meets standards
- **Tests are fast and independent**

## Output

**This skill produces:**
- Test files written before implementation
- Implementation code that passes tests
- Refactored, clean code
- High test coverage
- Confidence in changes
